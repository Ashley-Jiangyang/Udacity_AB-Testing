    "If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos\n",

    "\n",
    "### Two types of metrics measure how the experiment group performs better than the control group - __Invariant Metrics__ and __Evaluation Metrics__. \n",
    "\n",
    "__[Invariant Metrics]__ are what we usually use for sanity checks - checking whether the distribution in control and experiment group is similar or not - It performing some consistent checking across all of our experiment. In another word, this means we would not expect a change between the experiment and the control group for these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __Number of cookies__: The number of unique cookies to view the course overview page ($d_{min}$=3000). This is the unit of diversion. People won't be able to see the prompt unless they click the \"Start Free Trail\" button, so the number of cookies is not expected to change. It is therefore appropriate as an invariant metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __Number of clicks__: The number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger) ($d_{min}$=240). The same reason of counting the \"Number of cookies\" as an invariant can be applied here - we wouldn't expect to see a change between the experiment and control group since at this point, student who click the \"Start free trail\" button haven't get a chance to see the prompt of time commitment.     \n",
    "   - __Click-through-probability__: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page ($d_{min}$=0.01). Since the number of cookie and number of clicks are both invariant due to the fact that the user behavior won't change before they see the new feature we tested on, hence the Click-through-probability is a good invariant metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Evaluation Metrics]__ are the metrics in which we expect to see a difference or change between the experiment and the control group as a function of the experiment. Aiming at the minimizing the student frustration and maximizing the limited coaching resource as the ultimate business goal, each evaluation would have a minimum difference __($d_{min}$)__ that would have to observed before that was a meaningful change for the business.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - __Gross conversion__: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button ($d_{min}$= 0.01). We are expecting to see a reduced gross conversion in the experiment group.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - __Retention__: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout ($d_{min}$=0.01).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - __Net conversion__: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button ($d_{min}$= 0.0075).\n",

    "    2. but more student staying beyond the free trail. More specifically, Gross conversion is both statistically and practically significant lower, and net conversion is not lower than the practical limit ( -0.75%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will launch the new feature if both criteria are fulfilled.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Unused Metrics]__\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __Number of user-ids__: The number of users who enroll in the free trial ($d_{min}$=50). This is neither an invariant metric nor an evaluation metric. User-ids are tracked only after enrolling in the free trail so we would not expect equal distribution between the control and experience group. Besides, this metric is not robust enough to evaluate the experiment. A row count might be able to track the students stayed beyond the 14 day free trail boundary, however, it's hard to evaluate the change or difference in the same scale - that's also why Gross Conversion is a good evaluation metric, it is normalized by the number of cookies.

    "The results of the Gross Conversion is absolutely lower with the new feature, which indicates that adding this feature might be helpful to lower the frustration at the very first beginning. And our first criterion is fulfilled. However, there is some risk of declining profit (Net Conversion) since the confidence interval include the negative practical limit. The second condition is not passed. Recall that in the previous launch criteria section we predetermined that we only launch the experiment only if both condition are fulfilled."
